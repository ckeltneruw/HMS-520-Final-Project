Format: Analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R

Overall goal: (1) Identify how influenza immunization rates differ by demographic and health characteristics, (2) determine whether immunization differs among four regions in the U.S, and (3) establish linear model for predicting immunization based on demographics and health characteristics 

Plan and Timeline:
  - Download 2021 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data set
  - Clean data in R
  - Subset data and variables of interest
  - Calculate immunization rates (number immunized divided by population at-risk)
  - Run logistic and linear regession analyses to determine which demographic, geographic, and health variables are most strongly associated with having been immunized and immunization rates
  - Plot pertinent findings using ggplot
  - Compile key results and figures into powerpoint presentation
  - Complete final draft of presentation by December 11th and final project by December 14th 

Goals:
  - Improve data analysis skills
  - Increase familiarity with presenting data to an audience
  - Gain experience performing important data analysis and visualization tasks in R
