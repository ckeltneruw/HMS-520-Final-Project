Team members: Case Keltner and Huong Chu

Format: Analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R

Overall goal: (1) Identify how influenza immunization rates differ by demographic and health characteristics, (2) determine whether immunization differs among four regions in the U.S, and (3) conduct regression analyses for predicting immunization based on demographics and health characteristics 

Plan and Timeline:
  - Download 2021 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data set
  - Clean data in R
  - Subset data and variables of interest
  - Determine gross and stratum-specific immunization percentages
  - Plot pertinent findings using ggplot
  - Run logistic and linear regession analyses to determine which demographic, geographic, and health variables are most strongly associated with having been immunized
  - Conduct lasso regression for more precise estimation of regression coefficients
  - Compile key results and figures into powerpoint presentation
  - Complete final draft of presentation by December 11th and final project by December 14th 

Goals:
  - Improve data analysis skills
  - Increase familiarity with presenting data to an audience
  - Gain experience performing important data analysis and visualization tasks in R
