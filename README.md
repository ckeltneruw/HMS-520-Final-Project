# HMS-520-Final-Project

Team members: Case Keltner and Huong Chu

Format: Analyzing a dataset that uses data wrangling and modeling tools in R

Overall goal: (1) Identify how influenza immunization rates differ by demographic and health characteristics, (2) determine whether immunization differs among four regions in the U.S, and (3) establish linear model(s) for predicting immunization based on demographic and health characteristics

Dataset Used: 2021 CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data set (URL: https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annual_data/annual_2021.html) 

Dataset Description: BRFSS is a collaborative effort between all states and participating territories in the US and participating US and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The BRFSS is administered by CDC's Population Health Surveillance Branch, under the Division of Population Health at CDC’s National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and Health Promotion. The BRFSS utilizes health-related telephone surveys that involve health-related risk behaviors (ex.: smoking), chronic health conditions (ex.: asthma), healthcare access (ex.: possession of insurance), and use of preventive services (ex.: colonoscopy) from the noninstitutionalized US adult population (≥ 18 years).
The BRFSS began in 1984, and it has evolved to the point where the BRFSS now collects data in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and participating US territories. In 2021, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, and the US Virgin Islands collected BRFSS data. 
BRFSS’s purpose is to collect uniform state-specific data on potentially risky health behaviors, chronic health conditions, healthcare access, and preventive health services' utilization related to the predominant causes of death and disability in the US. 

Project Process: 
Clean data in R
Subset data and variables of interest
Calculate immunization rates (number immunized divided by population at-risk)
Run logistic and linear regession analyses to determine which demographic, geographic, and health variables are most strongly associated with having been immunized and immunization rates
Plot pertinent findings using ggplot
Compile key results and figures into powerpoint presentation
Complete final draft of presentation by December 11th and final project by December 14th

Project Outcomes:

Goals:

Improve data analysis skills
Increase familiarity with presenting data to an audience
Gain experience performing important data analysis and visualization tasks in R
